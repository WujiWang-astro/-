**Jan. 28th 2020**
* Today first case of the coronavirus infection has been identified in Stanberg, Munich  
* I waer the sergical mask to go to ESO
* I just stare in front of me most of the time on U-banh and S-bahn to avoid the eye contacting with European people
* All the Asian people (only from my judgement) I see do not wear mask
* Only one man looks like European wear the mask but does not cover his nose
